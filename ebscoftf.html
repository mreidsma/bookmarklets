	<h1>Easily test the EBSCO Full Text Finder (FTF) New UI</h1>

	<p>EBSCO recently sent out instructions on how to test their new Full Text Finder (Link Resolver) interface, but they were lousy and not clear. plus, it involved a lot of typing like it was 1996. (It <em>is</em> 1996 at EBSCO, though.) I made a bookmarket that you can use on any Full Text Finder page to load GVSU's new FTF interface. Only works if you are already on a old Full Text Finder page.</p>

	<p><strong>Finding a Full Text Finder Page</strong>: The easy way is to search Library Search for something and look for the good ol' "Get it @ GVSU" button that is now going on 15 years old. Click that, and you'll see the old FTF. Click the bookmarklet and you'll see the same record in the new FTF.</p>

	<p>Don't know what Full Text Finder or a Link Resolver is? This bookmarklet is probably not for you.</p>

	<p><strong>Other libraries</strong>: copy the bookmarklet but change the root URL in the code before '<code>/result/</code> to whatever your OPID is. Read the cryptic marketing email from EBSCO to see a few breadcrumbs that can lead you there. Alternatively, just look at ours.</p>

	<h2>Installing</h2> 

	<p>To install, drag the link below to your bookmarks toolbar:</p>
