	<h1>Easily test the EBSCO Full Text Finder (FTF) New UI</h1>

	<p><a href="https://more.ebsco.com/index.php/email/emailWebview?email=Njg5LUxOUS04NTUAAAGSkdtXxnwX1rKXrIyDXHejk1PLBFY3uwT1eiOCUbFxw_RMTQqGknh4Cj_vaJXPXJa6tdwE30NEy2BprSODkZWdFssQoRGDZfF4GQ">EBSCO recently sent out instructions on how to test their new Full Text Finder</a> (Link Resolver) interface, but they were not very clear or easy. Plus, it involved a lot of typing every time you want to test like it was 1996. (It <em>is</em> 1996 at EBSCO, though.) I made a bookmarket that you can use on any Full Text Finder page to load GVSU's new FTF interface. Only works if you are already on a old Full Text Finder page. Only takes one click per preview.</p>

	<p><strong>Finding a Full Text Finder Page</strong>: The easy way is to search <a href="https://gvsu.edu/library/">GVSU's Library Search</a> for something and look for the good ol' "Get it @ GVSU" button that is now going on 15 years old. Click that, and you'll see the old FTF. Click the bookmarklet and you'll see the same record in the new FTF.</p>

	<p> The easiest way (if you have a GVSU username and password) is to <a href="https://resolver-ebscohost-com.ezproxy.gvsu.edu/openurl?sid=EBSCO:edswss&genre=article&issn=09669582&ISBN=&volume=30&issue=8&date=20220523&spage=2013&pages=2013-2028&title=JOURNAL%20OF%20SUSTAINABLE%20TOURISM&atitle=Organisational%20effectiveness%20for%20ethical%20tourism%20action%3A%20a%20phronetic%20perspective&aulast=Tomassini%2C%20Lucia&id=DOI:10.1080/09669582.2021.1963974">visit this classic FTF page</a> and then use the bookmarket. Hurrah!</p>

	<p>Don't know what Full Text Finder or a Link Resolver is? This bookmarklet is probably not for you.</p>

	<p><strong>Other libraries</strong>: copy the bookmarklet but change the root URL in the code before '<code>/result/</code> to whatever your OPID is. Read the cryptic marketing email from EBSCO to see a few breadcrumbs that can lead you there. Alternatively, if you go to your classic FTF page and click the bookmarklet as-is, you'll see GVSU's new UI. Close enough.</p>
